Project idea 1: Analysis of Prevelant Diseases based on the Inventory Management at Pharmacy

Desc:
The project will be an Inventory Management system for Pharmacies. The initial setup for the system will include the opening stock, the minimum threshold for each medicines and the medicine description- name, content and the symptoms which it is meant to treat. The order and sell of the medicines are noted. The owner will be notified when any of the medicines' stock need to be refilled, based on the minimum and an order can be placed. Monthly reports will be generated which will have reports on the sale of medicines and the prevelant illness ongoing in the region.

Goal:
The main theme of the project will be to gather insights based on the sale of the medicines at pharmacy. Based on a particular medicine sold, we can identify the probable illness for which the medicine is targeted to treat. This data can be gathered over a period of time and help predict the common, ongoing illness that are present in that region. This data can be further leveraged to take preventive measures to contain the diseases and also carry out awareness campaigns.
