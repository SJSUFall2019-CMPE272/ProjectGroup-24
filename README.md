**Abstract**
 
Many valuable information regarding the public health and welfare, disease outbreaks and their trend are available in the form of unstructured data lying in different news portals, Facebook, Twitter. It becomes important to become aware of the current diseases and to filter out relevant and correct information. This is especially important for commercial pharmacies as their need to be updated with the current outbreak in their region and also be ready stock-wise for the drugs needed to treat them. Our objective with Well-Pharma is to address this problem and built a system for the pharmacies which will analyse the disease outbreaks in all regions and carry out a disease-to-drug mapping and alert the pharmacist so as to keep the stock ready.

WellPharma will be a Web Application - built as an automated system for querying filtering and visualising the disease outbreak and to stock their respective drugs.
