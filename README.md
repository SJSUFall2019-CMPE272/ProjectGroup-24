**Abstract**
 
Many valuable information regarding the public health and welfare, disease outbreaks and their trend are available in the form of unstructured data lying in different news portals, Facebook, Twitter. It becomes important to become aware of the current diseases and to filter out relevant and correct information. This is especially important for commercial pharmacies as their need to be updated with the current outbreak in their region and also be ready stock-wise for the drugs needed to treat them. Our objective with Well-Pharma is to address this problem and built a system for the pharmacies which will analyse the disease outbreaks in all regions and carry out a disease-to-drug mapping and alert the pharmacist so as to keep the stock ready.

WellPharma will be a Web Application - built as an automated system for querying filtering and visualising the disease outbreak and to stock their respective drugs.

**Target User**

The main target user for the application will be the commercial pharmacies. The system will provide insights to the pharmacists on which drugs need to be stocked as per the current disease outbreak. 

**Process Flow**

The main objective of the system will be to gather information regarding the disease outbreaks, location-wise through web crawling the public websites such as Twitter, Facebook and new articles on Google. This information will then be cleaned and will be classified location-wise,uisng NLP and NER. The system will also maintain the data for disease to drug mapping. This data will be mapped with the location-wise diseases. The user(pharmacist) requests states his location, based on which the system provides the diseases prevalent in the region and the drugs corresponding to them. The data can help identify which drugs are needed to be stocked such that there is no shortage.
