Project Idea 1:  WellPharma  -
Analysis of Prevelant Diseases based on the Inventory Management at Pharmacy

Desc:
Nowadays the health issues are growing and identifying is becoming difficult.This can be solved with the proposed system. The system will predict the prevalent diseases in the particular region based on the data collected from Pharmacies. The system will be an Inventory Management system for Pharmacies. The initial setup for the system will include the opening stock, the minimum threshold for each medicines and the medicine description- name, content and the symptoms which it is meant to treat. The order and sell of the medicines are noted. The pharmacy owner will be notified when any of the medicines' stock need to be refilled, based on the minimum and an order can be placed. Monthly reports will be generated which will have reports on the sale of medicines and the prevalent illness ongoing in the region.

Goal:
The main theme of the project will be to gather insights based on the sale of the medicines at pharmacy. Based on a particular medicine sold, we can identify the probable illness for which the medicine is targeted to treat. This data can be gathered over a period of time and help predict the common, ongoing illness that are present in that region. This data can be further leveraged to take preventive measures to contain the diseases and also carry out awareness campaigns.

Project Idea 2: AlertMe! -
Emergency News Notification	

Desc:
The main purpose of this project is provide the users with emergency notifications based on their location. The application will fetch data from Twitter tweets of the users and based on it, the news or event will get categorized, for example, fires, sports, shopping, music, etc. Moreover, the emergency alerts will be sent to the user, informing them if any fire shooting is going on in some area. This data will be also shown on Maps so that they can know where the event has occured.

Goal: 
The target of this project will be the civilians who need to be aware of what is happening in the area and get updated based on the notifications provided by the application. The users will be cautious of travelling to some accident prone areas.

Project idea 3: Builidng Security using Face Recognition

Desc:
The project will mainly include an application to the builiding management office and tenants, wherein the faces of the tenants will be saved. At the entrance of the building, the faces of the tenants would be chehcked by the camera and with the help of the image processing the identity of the person would be verified. This eliminates the need of caring traditional keys all the time and also making it more secure than the passcode. 

Goal:
The tenants would not need to carry keys to access the building. Additionally it makes it secure than access code system used as an alternative to the keys.
